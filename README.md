- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicholas-camarda, an MD/PhD student (Exp. Grad. 2026) at Tufts School of Medicine working in the Jaffe Lab of the Molecular Cardiology Research Institute.
    - 👀 I'm applying into ophthalmology (-> retina)
    - 💾 I am interested in designing and applying machine learning methods to build more robust predictive models, risk analysis platforms, and biomarker discovery pipelines for data-driven decision making in medicine. 
- 🌱 I just finished my PhD investigating mitigating strategies for VEGF receptor inhibitor-induced hypertension and endothelial cell dysfunction. 
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on any project that can leverage R or Python expertise :)
