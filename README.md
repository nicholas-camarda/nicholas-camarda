- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicholas-camarda, an MD/PhD student (Exp. Grad. 2026) at Tufts School of Medicine working in the Jaffe Lab of the Molecular Cardiology Research Institute.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning applications to medicine, and I'm interested in becoming an ophthalmologist (retinal surgery) working at the intersection of science, technology, and medicine.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing up my PhD investigating mitigating strategies for VEGF receptor inhibitor-induced hypertension and endothelial cell dysfunction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can leverage R or Python expertise :)
