- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicholas-camarda, an MD/PhD student (Exp. Grad. 2026) at Tufts University working in the Jaffe Lab of the Molecular Cardiology Research Institute.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning applications to biology and medicine, and statistical methodology!
- 🌱 I’m working on a project now to understand whether/how vascular cells respond differently or similarly to cancer cells after targeted cancer therapy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can leverage R or Python expertise :)
